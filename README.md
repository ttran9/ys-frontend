# Frontend for Yelp Search App

# Overview

- I am creating this repo to brush up/refresh my knowledge with React, Webpack, CSS, and Jasmine to create a frontend application leveraging a Node backend.
- Will add a link later to the backend repo
- Will also upload this to a cloud provider (unsure of what I am using)

# Branch Summary (Not sure how to organize this as it will become very long)
- 1. 1-boilerplate-code
  - 1a. Create necessary files to get a very simple home page react app running in a development environment as well as enabling docker support for this. I'll also include a very basic Jasmine test to test if a component can be rendered on the page.
